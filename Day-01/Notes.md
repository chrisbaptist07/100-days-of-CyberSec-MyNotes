# Day-01: 100 Days of Cybersecurity🚀

**Date:** January 10, 2026  
**Topic:** Official Launch & GitHub Setup

## Session Overview
The session marks the official start of the "100 Days of Cybersecurity" challenge. Vyshu introduces the team and outlines changes from last year's format, emphasizing practical learning over 100 separate topics. Phase 1 will cover ~25 consolidated topics starting with ethical hacking and cybersecurity fundamentals tomorrow. The focus is community-driven learning through GitHub contributions and personal notes tracking.

## GitHub Repository Setup Guide
Access the main repo via GitHub user search: **vnocv** → **100-days-of-cyber-security**.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1. **Star the repo** to show support and track interest.
2. **Fork the repo** to your account/organization (rename optional, e.g., "101-days-of-cyber-security").
   - Ensure "Copy the main branch" is checked.
3. **Create 'notes' branch** from main branch for personal daily journals.
   - Switch branches: Click branch icon → "Create new branch" → name it "notes".
4. **Main branch**: For community contributions only (e.g., update outdated docs like Kali Linux links).
5. **Notes branch**: Personal learning logs.
   - Create files: `day-01/README.md` (use forward slash for directories).
   - Write notes in Markdown (preview renders automatically).
   - Commit with description (e.g., "Day 01: GitHub setup notes").

**Key Rule**: No notes in main branch—use notes branch only. Contributions to main reviewed; last year received many improper note PRs.

## Upcoming Structure Changes
- **Last Year Issue**: 100 topics overwhelming; nobody completed all.
- **This Year**: Consolidated (~25 topics in Phase 1), hands-on focus.
- **Day 02 Preview**: Proper ethical hacking intro (beyond basics), networking (1-2 days, topologies with VMs/Docker), OS fundamentals (Windows/Linux/PowerShell commands).
- Home labs emphasized for practical setups.

## Key Takeaways & Action Items
- Fork repo today and create notes branch.
- Track daily learnings (e.g., "API security: Postman install, basics").
- Contribute fixes to main (e.g., update VirtualBox/VMware/Kali docs).
- Add to resume: "Completed 100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge via GitHub."
- Join volunteer program for certifications.

**Pro Tip**: GitHub essential for cybersecurity—not just devs. Understand dev workflows to spot security issues.
